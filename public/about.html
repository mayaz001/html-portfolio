<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Mohammad Ayaz, an Embedded Software Engineer currently based in Okazaki, Aichi, Japan. 
My journey in the field of Autosar projects has been both challenging and rewarding. 
Throughout my career, I have honed my skills and achieved notable accomplishments.</p>

<p>One of my notable achievements includes developing and optimizing core, log and trace, and time synchronization
modules for Autosar projects. Through my efforts, I successfully reduced the system response time by 20% and 
significantly improved performance metrics. This achievement has reinforced my passion for optimizing software and 
driving efficiency in complex systems.</p>
  
<p>During my tenure at Denso-ADIT, I have taken on various responsibilities with dedication and commitment. 
I have conducted comprehensive analysis of Autosar software requirements, leading to the implementation of robust 
testing strategies. Achieving a remarkable 95% test coverage, I have ensured the reliability and quality of the 
software.</p>
  
<p>My attention to detail and commitment to excellence is evident in my role of debugging codes and implementing 
new features. Through these efforts, I have successfully reduced the bug count by 20%, contributing to the overall 
stability of the software.</p>
  
<p>Safety and quality are of utmost importance to me. I have performed static code analysis, addressing warnings 
and ensuring a desired safety level. This meticulous approach has resulted in zero critical defects during the 
testing phase. Additionally, I have been proactive in creating comprehensive documentation, including software 
architecture, requirements, detailed design, and test results. This has not only facilitated efficient development 
processes but also reduced product development time by 50%.</p>
  
<p>Collaboration and teamwork are essential to achieving success in any project. I have worked closely with 
cross-functional teams, conducting rigorous testing on critical systems. Through effective communication and 
coordination, we were able to reduce overall defects by 30%.</p>
  
<p>In addition to my technical skills, I have acquired certifications and training to enhance my professional 
capabilities. These include comprehensive safety training on ISO26262 and IEC61508 automotive functional safety, 
as well as becoming a Certified SaFe 5 Practitioner, enabling me to implement agile methodologies and frameworks.</p>
  
<p>My educational background includes a Bachelor of Technology in Electrical Engineering and a Bachelor of 
Technology in Materials Science Engineering from the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad.</p>
  
<p>In recognition of my academic achievements, I received the Academic Excellence Award from the Indian Institute 
of Technology, Hyderabad, for outstanding performance during the academic year 2018-19.</p>
  
<p>I am proud of my journey so far and look forward to further contributing my skills and expertise to the 
field of embedded software engineering.</p>
